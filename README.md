Welcome to **AI in Healthcare** from **Stanford Medicine**, a hands-on exploration of how data science and machine learning are reshaping the U.S. healthcare system.

In this repository, you'll journey through real-world applications of AI â€” from understanding clinical data and ethical challenges to building models that support equitable decision-making.

### ðŸš‘ What you'll discover inside:
- The structure and payment models of U.S. healthcare (*e.g., FFS, DRGs, capitation*)  
- How to mine and evaluate clinical data from EHRs, even when it's imperfect  
- Hands-on machine learning workflows for classification, segmentation & risk prediction  
- Real-world capstone projects simulating a patientâ€™s care path from symptoms to treatment  
- Regulatory and ethical considerations in deploying AI in clinical environments

Whether you're a data scientist, healthcare analyst, or just curious about how AI can improve patient outcomes â€” *this repo is built to inspire, educate, and spark new ideas.*
