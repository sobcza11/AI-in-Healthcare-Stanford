Welcome to **AI in Healthcare** from **Stanford Medicine** — a practical dive into how machine learning transforms care delivery.

This repository equips healthcare innovators to:

- TDecode U.S. payment models (<i>FFS, DRGs, capitation</i>)  
- Extract actionable insight from real-world EHR data, despite missingness & bias  
- Hands-on machine learning workflows for classification, segmentation & risk prediction  
- Build risk stratification & diagnostic models tailored to clinical workflows  
- Simulate full care journeys — from patient presentation to therapeutic intervention
- Evaluate regulatory & ethical guardrails in clinical-grade AI

Built for MedTech engineers, digital health analysts, and data-first care teams.

Be responsible.
